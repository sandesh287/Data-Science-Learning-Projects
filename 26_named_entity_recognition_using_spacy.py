# 26. Named Entity Recognition (NER) using Spacy
# This project demonstrates how to extract and classify named entities such as people, organizations, locations, dates, and monetary values from text using Spacy's pre-trained language model. It processes sample text, and identify relevant entities and visualize them using Spacy's Displacy tool. The extracted entities are organized into pandas dataframe, and then saved as a CSV file for further analysis. This project highlights key NLP concepts such as text tokenization, entity recognition, and data visualization, making it ideal for beginners and data enthusiasts exploring real world applications of natural language processing.
